# TI-Robotic-Systems-Learning-Kit

## The Texas Instruments Robotic System Learning Kit (RSLK) consist of:
1. MSP432 Launchpad : MSP432, an **ARM Cortex M4F** processor, act as a main controller to a robotic system.
1. DC motors
1. IR Sensor for measuring distance to an obstacle
1. Reflectance sensor to detect the presence of a colour line below the robot, 
1. Bump sensor to detect collision with obstacles
1. Tachometer to measure the rotation speed of the motor
1. Switches and LEDs to provide means communication between user and the RSLK. 

Through this setup, various microcontroller hardware/software concepts can be taught, these include GPIO handling, exception handling, pulse width modulation (PWM), timer compare and capture operations, analog-to-digital converter (ADC), asynchronous serial communication and finite-state machine design.

**These codes were written as a part of NTU CE2007- Microprocessor Based System Design<br/>**
**To edit and debug these codes, [TI Code Composer Studio](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Download_CCS%20?DCMP=slulplaunch&HQS=ep-con-lprf-slulplaunch-pr-sw-ccs-en#Code_Composer_Studio_Version_7_Downloads) is required**
